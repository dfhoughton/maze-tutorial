I am using this document to jot down thoughts about using this bit of code as a tutorial.

 - [ ] Meta-points
   - [ ] mostly this is about building a mental framework to think about things
   - [ ] history of programming
     - [ ] in the early days, programmers were cheap and computers, expensive
       - [ ] the programmer strove to think like a computer
     - [ ] nowadays it's the programmers who are expensive
       - [ ] the programmer strives to think like *other programmers* who need to understand the code
       - [ ] the computer still exercizes no creativity or independent choice, but it's good follows human-oriented code well enough
   - [ ] it takes a while to develop fluency, but this is something that comes with practice
     - [ ] pleasure in the process is paramount
     - [ ] take breaks
 - [ ] regarding maze generator
   - [ ] Point out the three parts: HTML, CSS, javascript
     - [ ] HTML: the framework of the page
     - [ ] CSS: lipstick and finery
     - [ ] javascript: makes the page change, perhaps in reaction to what the user does
   - [ ] Elements of a program
     - [ ] some sort of entry point
     - [ ] reactive/asynchronous vs procedural
     - [ ] loops
     - [ ] variables
     - [ ] DRY
     - [ ] objects/classes
     - [ ] functions/closures
     - [ ] comments
     - [ ] side effects
     - [ ] APIs
   - [ ] more esoteric javascript/HTML stuff
     - [ ] DOM
     - [ ] generators
     - [ ] timeouts
     - [ ] events
     - [ ] the rendering cycle
 - [ ] more esoteric programming concepts
   - [ ] types
   - [ ] inheritance
   - [ ] caching
   - [ ] functional programming
 - [ ] important programming skills
   - [ ] typing
   - [ ] googling
   - [ ] version control
   - [ ] dealing with other programmers
