# Maze Tutorial

This is some code I wrote to help people learn coding concepts. It's in HTML and javascript because
those are accessible to everyone with a web browser. The idea is that the learner will learn by
improving the starting maze.

## Acknowledgements

I started doing this because I'm tutoring a student in my town named Oscar. I initially thought we'd
start from scratch and build a maze generator. Then I thought I'd test out the assignment myself to
see how feasible it was and so I could answer questions quickly. Then it was fun, so I kept going. Then
I needed to make a Christmas present for my nephew Morgen and it occurred to me that they were eager to
learn programming skills, so I could improve the maze generator, dress it up in Christmas finery, and
continue as above: learn by improving existing code. In a week or so Oscar may join in this version
of the tutorial.

My son Jude should be teaching this tutorial, not me. He was a better programmer and Morgen's peer. Well,
here's to you, Jude. We miss you.
